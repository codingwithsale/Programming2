# Notes (14.4.2023.)

He explained IDEs, how to run code etc.
He started with basics, from HelloWorld, scaning variables, math operations...
Than he introduced more data types like:
    - double (he showed the difference between int and double)
    - bool (how true/false work in c++)

Increment and decrement operators - finally understood them
He showed another way to skip line [endl is same as \n]

Next thing were conditions.
    - He explained it with simple if...else using bool variable.
    - Than he has expanded the previous example with additional else if statement for *fasting* :D

Than he converted to switch...case
    - BREAK your cases !!!
    - don't forget about brake please don't
    - he showed how to group cases

The last thing he covered before the break were loops
    - for
    - while
        - he showed us how infinite loops work
        - than he explained how to break infinite loops with break statement
        - he showed that the first time while loop's condition is not satisfied, the while loop will break
    - do while
    - he explained why we use each one of them

BREAK

CHAR
- After the break, first thing he explanied were chars, and how chars work with strings.
- Complicated stuff, explained through code.


FUNCTIONS
- He explanied how to call functions, the void ones, the ones with parameters or not etc.
- We need to be careful with defining functions. 
    If we have several functions that share name, if parameters are not carefully defined, 
    compiler mignt not be able to understand which function to trigger.
- He also showed the way return works and some of its pros.


PASS BY REFERENCE
Simplest explanation from lab sessions, nothing too complicated.

ARRAY
- declaration: 
    int arr[num_of_elements]; --> empty array
    int arr[3] = {[0] : 1, [1] : 2, [2] : 3}; --> array with values

- we can pass arrays to functions: 
    void printArr(int x[], int num){
        for (int i = 0; i < num; i++){
            cout << x[i] << endl;
        }
    }

- vector library used to eliminate some problems with arrays --> won't be on midterm
